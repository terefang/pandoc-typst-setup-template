***Spelljamming Helm Interface.*** The horror attaches to a *spelljamming helm*

creature is already attuned to the helm, that creature’s attunement to the helm 
ends when the horror’s attunement begins. The horror can operate the helm even 
though it isn’t a spellcaster. The horror can detach from the helm as a bonus 
action, which ends its attunement to the helm.
